			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to start to think of tasks and simple computer games and turn them into Pseudocoding
						</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The most complicated thing was trying to understand if I was required to actually code the games
						or if I was just writing out comments. </p>
			</div>
			<h2>Checkers Game Screenshot</h2>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I am happy with this assignment, I think it went very well and I put a lof of time and effort into it.
						Even by going to a tutor to make sure I understood what was going on. </p>

			<h2>Checkers Game Pseudocode</h2>
			<pre>
			// Set Up the Game
			//   Create an 8x8 board with alternating dark/light squares
			//   Place red and black pieces on the appropriate squares (first 3 rows for each)
			//   Set player turn (e.g., red starts first)
			//   Display initial board
			
			// Handle Player Turns
			//   Highlight selectable pieces for the current player
			//   Wait for player to select a piece
			//   Highlight valid move options for that piece
			//   Wait for player to choose a valid move
			//   Move piece to new location
			//   If the move is a jump, remove the captured opponent piece
			//   If the piece reaches the last row, crown it a king
			
			// Enforce Game Rules
			//   Only allow diagonal forward movement (unless king)
			//   Enforce jumps when available (mandatory capture)
			//   Prevent illegal moves
			
			// Check for End of Game
			//   After each turn, check if a player has no legal moves
			//     If so, declare the other player the winner
			
			// Switch Turns
			//   After a move, switch the turn to the other player
			//   If another jump is possible with the same piece, allow chained jump before switching
			
			// End the Game
			//   Announce the winner
			//   Offer option to restart or exit the game
			</pre>
